## 👨‍💻 Need Creative Development Services?
Sweet! I'm a Creative Technical Product Developer. I love creative writing, copywriting, proofreading/editing, coming up with *wild* ideas, and building cool tech thangs.

I'm currently working on a few projects, but I'm always open to new opportunities! I'm also available for freelance work  and contract work.

If I'm not working on a project or building a product, I'm probably creating fictional technical documentation, drafting an article, reading a book, or learning something new.

Need tech help? I'm usually working with:
 - Ruby on Rails, Hugo, Bridgetown, Middleman, Sinatra, Astro, etc.
 - [Reach me on the App formally known as the Bird App](https://twitter.com/malcreatesstuff).
