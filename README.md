## 👨‍💻 Need Creative Development Services?
Sweet! I'm a Creative Technical Product Developer. I love creative writing, copywriting, proofreading/editing, coming up with *wild* ideas, and building beautiful, fast, and product-focused websites and web apps.
If I'm not working on a project or building a product, I'm probably creating fictional technical documentation, drafting an article, reading a book, or learning something new.

Need tech help? I'm usually working with:
 - Ruby on Rails, Hugo, Bridgetown, Middleman, Sinatra, Astro, etc.
 - [Hire me](https://noonthirty.one).
